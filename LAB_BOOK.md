## 1. Lab Vision and Mission

- **Mission**: To advance the understanding of **gene regulation and cancer biology** using computational biology, multi-omics integration, and machine learning.
- **Values**: We prioritize open science, reproducibility, inclusivity, collaboration, and curiosity-driven exploration.
- **Commitment**: Knowledge should serve both science and society. We aim for impact in **precision medicine, cancer research, and global health equity**.

## 2. Lab Culture and Expectations

### 2.1 Core Principles

- **Open & Reproducible Science**: All work must be transparent and reproducible. Use Git/GitHub for version control, and document code with READMEs and comments. Share preprints and open data when possible.
- **Inclusivity & Respect**: We welcome diversity in gender, race, culture, and background. Everyoneâ€™s voice matters in meetings and collaborations.
- **Mental Health First**: Research is important, but your well-being is more important. Speak up if you feel overwhelmed; taking time off is encouraged and supported.
- **Collaboration Over Competition**: We aim to solve scientific questions together. Knowledge-sharing is a strength, not a weakness.

### 2.2 Expectations from Members

- Work ethically, honestly, and diligently.
- Maintain **digital lab notebooks** with daily/weekly progress.
- Contribute to group activities: journal clubs, group meetings, mentorship of new students.
- Treat colleagues with respect, patience, and generosity.

### 2.3 Expectations from the PI

- Provide **clear guidance** on projects and career planning.
- Ensure access to necessary resources (computing, datasets, funding for conferences).
- Be available for weekly/biweekly meetings.
- Support students in publishing, presenting, and developing independence.

## 3. Lab Practices

### 3.1 Research Workflow

- **Version Control**: All projects should have a GitHub repo. Use branches, commits, and pull requests.
- **Data Management**: Store raw and processed data in structured directories with README files. Metadata must be included.
- **Reproducibility**: Prefer Docker, Singularity, or Conda environments. Ensure analyses can be rerun by others with minimal effort.
- **FAIR Principles**: All data and code should be **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable** whenever possible.

### 3.2 Meetings

- **Weekly Lab Meeting**: Research updates, troubleshooting, and brainstorming.
- **Journal Club**: Rotating leadership â€” present a recent paper, lead discussion, and relate it to our labâ€™s research.
- **One-on-One Meetings**: With the PI (weekly or biweekly) to discuss progress, challenges, and career goals.

### 3.3 Communication

- **Slack**: For day-to-day lab coordination.
- **Email**: For official communications.

## 4. Mentorship and Development

- **Training**: New members will receive mentorship in computational biology, statistics, machine learning, and reproducibility.
- **Individual Development Plans (IDP)**: Each student defines yearly goals for research, skill-building, and career development.
- **Conferences**: Lab members are encouraged (and supported) to attend international meetings such as ISMB, BOSC, AACR, and ASHG.
- **Skill Building**: Opportunities to teach, mentor, code-review, and write manuscripts.

## 5. Mental Health and Work-Life Balance

- **Work Hours**: Flexible â€” results matter more than presence. Core hours for meetings are expected, but beyond that, you manage your time.
- **Vacations**: Take your full entitlement of vacation days. Extended leave for personal/family reasons is respected.
- **Support**: The lab is a safe space to discuss stress, burnout, and challenges. Confidentiality is respected.
- **Campus Resources**: Please reach out to Student Life team regarding counseling & wellness services.

## 6. Authorship, Credit, and Data Sharing

- **Authorship Policy**: Determined by contribution, following guidelines from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). Discuss authorship early and revisit if contributions change.
- **Preprints**: Strongly encouraged to share work early with the community.
- **Open Source Code**: All code should be shared under permissive licenses (MIT/GPL/CCBY).
- **Data Sharing**: Submit datasets to GEO, SRA, or Zenodo as appropriate.

## 7. Onboarding Checklist (for New Members)
